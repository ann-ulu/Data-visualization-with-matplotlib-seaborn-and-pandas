# Data-visualization-with-matplotlib-seaborn-and-pandas

This project provides basic examples of data visualization using Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. The examples include simple line plots and multiple line plots to illustrate the usage of these libraries.
The script includes several examples of data visualization:

```
x = [2, 5, 7]
y = [9, 10, 12]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("test plot")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.show()
```
